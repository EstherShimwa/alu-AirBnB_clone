This is the starting point of our Airbnb clone project. Right now, we’re building a simple command-line tool where you can create, update, delete, and view stuff like users, places, cities, and more.

It’s the foundation for everything that’s coming next like hooking it up to a database, building out a web interface, and adding REST APIs.

We’re just getting started, so stick around  more features and docs are on the way soon
